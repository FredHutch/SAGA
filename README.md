# SAGA
What's the role or SAGA in transcription genomwide?

Interestingly, in [Stark publication](http://emboj.embopress.org/content/37/16/e98896) a region at about positions 250 was found to be tAD in Drosophila. The reported gene used for their findings is developmental core promoter, which is inducible (same as the one we are using in our experiments with ARG3!!)[1]. 
We found the same using our predictor!!
