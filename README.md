# SAGA
What's the role or SAGA in transcription genomwide?

Interestingly, in [Stark publication](http://emboj.embopress.org/content/37/16/e98896) a region at about positions 250 was found to be tAD in Drosophila. The reported gene used for their findings is developmental core promoter, which is inducible (same as the one we are using in our experiments with ARG3!!).[<sup>1</sup>](#1)
We found the same using our predictor!!



I used a variant of Mateo's solution. I'm using this in Rmd files written in github flavored markdown (gfm) for a Jekyll powered website but the same Rmd files are being used to produce pdfs in various contexts. The Rmd files are math heavy and the math is displayed with MathJax on the website. So I needed a solution that works with gfm that is processed via Jekyll, works with pandoc->pdflatex, and is compatible with MathJax.
